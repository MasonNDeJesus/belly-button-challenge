# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 challenge repository

After the last 2 modules, I am now certain. Module 12 sucked.
Also, why did we have to this challenge with belly button data?

belly-button-code (folder) contains:
  -static/js (folder) contains
    -.gitkeep
    -app.js file for assignment
  -index.html for assignment. Simply clicking the file should open the webpage
  -samples.json for assignment. The wonderfully horrendous data itself.
